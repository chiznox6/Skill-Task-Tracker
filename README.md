## Project Description

Skill-Task Tracker is a developer portfolio dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and powered by a local JSON Server acting as a mock API. It allows developers to:

Edit their personal profile and skills
Add and manage portfolio projects
Track learning tasks or goals
Document and review learning notes

This project was created to meet all the criteria of the **Phase 1 Individual Project** and demonstrates full CRUD functionality, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous interaction with an API — all in a polished, and user-friendly single-page interface.
